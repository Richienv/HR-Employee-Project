Overview: This project develops a machine learning model to enhance employee selection processes in HR. It aims to identify the most suitable candidates based on various metrics, improving recruitment efficiency and effectiveness.

Problem: The challenge lies in processing and analyzing large volumes of applicant data to accurately predict the best candidates, reducing time and resources spent on manual selection.

Solution: The notebook utilizes several machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, for candidate prediction. Preliminary results indicate XGBoost as a promising approach due to its performance in classification tasks.

Details: The model leverages candidate data such as previous experience, skills, and other relevant metrics. Initial tests show promising accuracy in identifying suitable candidates, with XGBoost providing the most valuable insights.
